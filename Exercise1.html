                <p><b>Introduction to this dataset:</b></p>
				<p>This dataset shows geographical location movements of one taxi on a single day in the New York City, and it was visually displayed on the website. Each time we click the ‘Begin’ button, one of the 30 cabs will be selected randomly to show its operation in one day of 2013. 
</p>
				<p><b>Potential Applications:</b></p>
                <p>We can track where every trip started and ended, the total number of passengers the taxi picked up, the summed up fares the driver earned, and the taxi rush hours. This dataset could also be used in examining the most popular pick-up area in the New York City and developing optimal routes to maximize the drivers’ gain.

				<p>Scott Murray is a software designer working on data visualization. He is a member of O’Reilly Media. He published book and teaching courses at O’Reilly.</p>
                <p><b>Why interested in this book:</b><p>		
				<p>This book introduces us D3, a JavaScript tool for visualizing data in web page. D3 is also mentioned in our Monday’s in-class presentation. This book is designed for nonprogrammers, so it is a good starting point to learn some visualization codes with little or no prior coding experience. </p>
